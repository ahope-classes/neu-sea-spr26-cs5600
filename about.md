## Course Description
Studies the structure, components, design, implementation, and internal operation of computer systems, focusing mainly on the operating system level. Reviews computer hardware and architecture including the arithmetic and logic unit, and the control unit. Covers current operating system components and construction techniques including the memory and memory controller, I/O device management, device drivers, memory management, file system structures, and the user interface. Introduces distributed operating systems. Discusses issues arising from concurrency and distribution, such as scheduling of concurrent processes, interprocess communication and synchronization, resource sharing and allocation, and deadlock management and resolution. Includes examples from real operating systems. Exposes students to the system concepts through programming exercises.
## Prerequisites
While the course does not have specific course prerequisites, students are expected to have reasonably strong experience in programming and a working knowledge of C.

Some understanding of key concepts in computer science at the undergraduate level, including computer architecture, operating systems, multi-threaded programming, networking, discrete mathematics, data structures, and algorithms, is presumed.
## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, the learner will be able to:

* trace the operation of context switching and program loading
* read part of an OS kernel and demonstrate an applied understanding of how abstract concepts apply to implementations and user programs
* use synchronization primitives (mutexes, semaphores, condition variables) to synchronize threads as demonstrated in a programming assignment
* describe operation of page tables and OS page faulting mechanisms for implementing demand allocation, demand loading, and copy-on-write 
* understand performance characteristics of hard drives; optionally demonstrate knowledge of RAID configurations via a programming assignment
* understand permissions and access control lists as implemented in Linux and Windows - optionally describe common software exploits.


# Course Materials

## Course Content


## Required Texts

This course will primarily utilize [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) by Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau. It is freely available online, and hard-copies are available for purchase. 

Other readings will be occasionally required and provided.  
## Communication

Communication between instructor, teaching assistants, and students is in English and is through

* E-mail via the Canvas distribution list
* Announcements posted on Canvas
* Notes and clarifications posted on Teams
* Private chats on Teams

Students are responsible for joining the class group on Teams and for ensuring that all email addresses are properly configured. Missing an email that is sent to Spam or not enrolling in Teams is not an excuse for any missed work or information.

You must check your Teams messages daily. We recommend that you install the Teams up on your mobile devices (phone, tablet) and turn on notifications so that you do not miss important messages or announcements.

To contact the instructor and the teaching assistant use Microsoft Teams as that ensures that communication is delivered and does not accidentally get filtered into “spam” or “junk” folders.

## Grading/Learning Assessment

## Work Submission

To receive full credit, all work for the course is expected to be completed by 11:59pm PT (Seattle Time) on the due date and must be submitted via Canvas. To foster fairness, all deadlines and due dates are to be strictly observed. Any graded work that is submitted after the due date is accepted with a 2.5% penalty for each day late until the solution is published or discussed in class, or until a date and time set by the instructor.

Mark your calendar with due dates as soon as a module is published and set reminders. Be particularly mindful of due times (AM versus PM) and time zones (all due times are PT/Seattle Time although your configuration of Canvas may be for a different time zone).

Submissions via email, as attachments to Canvas comments, Canvas Inbox messages, Teams, or through any manner other than via the Canvas assignment submission mechanism cannot be accepted under any circumstances. Any submissions received this way are not graded.

Check all submissions, including files, data sets, links, videos, and comments, prior and after submission to ensure that we have the correct work to grade. We grade what we receive. All submissions must be via Canvas and no submissions via email, Teams, direct messages, file attachments, or attachments to submission comments are accepted. Be sure to check that all links are publicly viewable when required.

When submitting, attach all required files or documents along with explanatory comments. Once an item has been graded, students will be able to view the grade and feedback via the grade book. Multiple submissions are accepted but only the last submission will be considered. After submission, check that your submission was successful.

All work is expected to be done in a professional and timely manner and must be written in English free of grammatical and spelling errors or a reduction in points will result. Using any third party material, ideas, or direct quotes must be properly cited. Anything directly copied must be placed in quotes and must be cited using either APA or MLA formats.

Be sure to frequently backup your work onto a cloud drive (OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, or similar; all students have a subscription for cloud storage on OneDrive and Google Drive through the University). **You may not backup to a public GitHub repository**. Alternatively, email your work and associated files to yourself frequently. Not meeting a deadline when work is lost because it was not backed up is not an acceptable excuse.

Be sure to have an alternative way to complete assignments in case of computer failure, e.g., borrow a computer, get a loaner from the University (Library or your Department), use a public computer on campus, use a secondary computer such as a ChromeBook, use posit.cloud, use repl.it, or a virtual machine on Azure, Google Cloud, or AWS, or similar.

## Collaboration

## Participation

Interaction occurs primarily through the University’s Microsoft Teams platform, although any graded peer group discussions are on Canvas. As part of each module, students are expected to:

* Complete all lessons and assigned work on time and within guidelines
* Be professional, courteous, and respectful in all communication
* Post their questions in the designated Teams channel
* Read all messages posted to Teams and Canvas daily
* Respond or comment on other students’ posts
* Join the live recitation sessions or watch the recording 

 ==Copying from the web or third parties without citation on any graded item is an academic integrity violations and results in a grade of 0 and a potential referral to OSCCR.==

Posts, questions, or responses on Teams are not graded and direct copying even without citation is allowed – but for those posts only.

## Code of Conduct
As a student in this course, students are expected conduct themselves at all times in a professional and respectful manner towards fellow students, instructors, teaching assistants, observers, graders, and anyone within or outside the course, College, University, and the community-at-large.

Specifically, students agree to:

* be speak in a respectful manner to instructors, teaching assistants, and graders
* resolve disputes over grades in a civil and constructive manner
* regard grades as a reflection of their mastery of the material, their commitment to timely submission or work, and the degree of mastery of the subject, and not as a token that is negotiated
* do all work on their own and to be students in the strictest sense of the word, i.e., one who studies and is an attentive and systematic observer
* not disparage others
* do all work in a timely fashion and when assigned
* to carefully read all assigned and provided material, study all lessons, and complete all graded and ungraded assignments, practices, laboratories, practicums, projects, reflections, quizzes, examinations, and any other exercises 
* use inclusive language and avoid actions that could be perceived as discriminatory or offensive
* embrace and respect the diversity of the class, which includes but is not limited to race, gender, age, sexual orientation, primary language, and cultural background
* attend all classes, recitations, except in cases of illness or emergencies, or to view recordings of the same as soon as being made available
* refrain from recording classes, recitations, chats, emails, or interactions, or sharing course materials without explicit permission by the instructor
* respond to surveys and polls, including any and all course evaluations

Egregious violations of the code of conduct may result in disciplinary actions, including reporting to University or College disciplinary committees and notation on the student’s academic record. Violations pertaining to learning may result in a reduction in scores or course grade.
